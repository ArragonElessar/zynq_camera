TODOs

[SOFTWARE] 

1. Read the datasheet thoroughly to find the configuration sequence
    - Also understand basics, what is hue, what are the different color modes etc.

2. Create a complete source code, logically clean, provides basic configuration for the camera.

[HARDWARE]
1. Custom IP creation for collecting and streaming video in data from the OV7670
    - custom AXI-4 Lite slave interface and a register address space. 
        - decide which datapoints are good enough to be included as a register
    - deep FIFO buffer to collect incoming 8 bit numbers, at each PCLK high. 
    - math to combine 2 - 8 bit ints to 16 bits - this represents a complete pixel.
    - move the pixel to either
        - another fifo where Video Out Systems can pick it up, using AXI4-Stream protocol
        - or store via a DMA to RAM (BRAM / DDR) so that our ARM processor can pick it up.

2. If time permits, learn about Xilinx ILA.
3. Think about testbenches and how we can test this ip.
4. Decent name for this IP.
